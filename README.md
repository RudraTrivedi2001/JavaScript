# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Repository**! This repository showcases my journey as I learn JavaScript. It is a collection of JavaScript programs I’m working on, aimed at understanding core concepts and building my skills. Each file in this repository is carefully crafted to ensure that even beginners can easily follow along and learn from it.

## Learning Path

I am learning JavaScript through the **Apna College JavaScript playlist** on YouTube, and I regularly update this repository with new programs as I progress. The playlist covers a variety of topics, and I’m continuously improving my JavaScript skills, creating new projects, and revising old ones.
